Our project has the following notebooks: 

1) Preprocssing & PreprocessingBinary: Notebooks for the preprocessing for both UNets
2) Classification: A classification approach (that was not used in the end but left in)
3) BinaryDeforestation: The notebook for the segmentation model that detects the deforestation events
4) UNet: The first notebook for iterations of the multi segmentation model (that was unused)
5) convnext-large-focal-loss: The notebook which contains the code for the multi segmentation model
6) Finalizing: The final pipeline + interpretation
